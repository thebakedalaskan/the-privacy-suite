 * One pass of the watcher (server.ts runs it every 5 seconds). It claims up to 20 due deposits in one statement,
 * pushing each one's next check `LEASE_S` ahead so another API instance's pass skips them, and works on 4 at a time.
 * Each is checked with its provider and the answer applied, and its next check set: an open deposit every 10 seconds
 * for 15 minutes, every minute until 2 hours, every 5 minutes for the rest of its first day, then hourly until
 * `give_up_at`; a cancelled one every 5 minutes for a day, then hourly; past `give_up_at`, or failed or expired, the
 * thinning `TAIL` (hourly, then 6-hourly, then daily). Open deposits are claimed ahead of the rest. When the provider can't answer, the state stays (logged at
 * warn) and it's asked again in a minute (on the `TAIL` once given up). Past `give_up_at` a settled answer is applied as
 * usual and anything else goes to `giveUp`; a provider that can't answer then leaves the deposit as it is, asked about
 * on the `TAIL` until it answers (see `unanswered`). A failed, expired or cancelled deposit is watched until 30 days
 * after its address expired, so a payment settled late still credits; then it isn't asked about again.
