summary: two or three plain sentences on what the meeting was about and where it landed. Start with the substance, not "The meeting" or "In this call".
decisions: what the people agreed or settled, one short sentence each. At most ${keeps(style).decisions}: the ones that matter most. An empty list if nothing was decided; something only suggested is not a decision. Something said only on a line ending "(unclear)" is a decision only if someone then agrees to it or says it again; otherwise leave it out of decisions and never write it as settled. Someone saying they'll do something, or agreeing to, is an action, not a decision: never list the same thing as both.
questions: what someone asked that the meeting didn't answer or settle by its end, one short question each. Before you write each one, look back at your summary and decisions: if they answer it, even in other words, the meeting answered it, so leave it out. At most ${keeps(style).questions}: the ones that matter most. An empty list if every question was answered.
actions: what someone said they, or someone else, would do, at most ${keeps(style).actions}: the ones that matter most. text starts with a verb, like "Send the new screens". owner is that person's name as the transcript gives it, or null if it doesn't say. due is when, as it was said ("Wednesday", "end of March"), or null.
keep, last in each decision, question and action: "yes" if it belongs in the notes; otherwise why it doesn't, and it's left out. Look through the transcript to its end before you give it. "aside": a joke or a passing remark nobody took up, or a how-to answered on the spot (where something goes, how to do it), which belongs in the job it's about, not a row of its own. "done": already done, found or answered in the meeting, however much later and in whatever words, or said not to matter. "maybe": a decision or action only floated, hedged ("might", "let me think about it") or put off, so nobody committed to it and nothing was decided; never a question. "personal": personal or social chat, not the meeting's work. "twice": a decision that is only a job someone takes on, or a question someone takes on finding out: its action holds it.
${SMALL_TALK} Never make a decision, question, action or chapter of it, and leave it out of the summary: a meeting that was only small talk gets one sentence that says so.
Each transcript line starts with its number, as in "L12 [03:41] Name: words". lines: the numbers of the lines each decision, question or action comes from, one to three of them, the ones where it was said, starting with the line where it first came up. against: the numbers of any lines where someone disagreed with it or said otherwise, at most two; an empty list if nobody did. Only numbers of lines you were sent. What you write is only proposed: people confirm decisions, and owners agree to their actions themselves. Never say someone agreed to something they didn't say.
chapters: the parts of the meeting in order, two to six of them (one for a short meeting). line is the number of the line the part starts with, as in the 12 of "L12 [03:41] Name: words", and only a number you were sent. title is two to five words. later, written before summary: if a later part of the meeting changes or answers something this part shows as chosen, set or still open, one short sentence that starts "Later," and says what it becomes ("Later, the date moves to the 9th.", "Later, they answer it: the venue is booked."); otherwise null. It's shown at the end of the summary. Never about a stretch marked "--". summary is one sentence of at most 30 words on this part alone.
suggestedQuestions: three short questions someone might ask about this meeting afterwards.

A line starting "[mm:ss] [screen N" says what was on a shared screen from then on, as it was read: whose screen, how legible it was, "key" because what was said refers to it or relies on what it shows, how its picture compares with the share's screen before it ("first of this share", "changed a little since screen M", "changed a lot since screen M"), its title, the words read on it ("Reads:"), what it shows beyond its words ("Shows:"), what had just changed on it ("Changed:"), and its numbered parts. A line "[mm:ss–mm:ss] [screens N–M same as screen K]" stands for screens whose picture stayed the same as screen K's then. A screen that is partly legible, unreadable or not read shows only what its line says: never fill in what couldn't be read.
screens: one entry for each screen N given in full in the transcript, up to ${keeps(style).screens} of them (if there are more, the ones people talked about most), {"n": N, "description": string}: one or two plain sentences on what it shows and what was being said about it then. If it couldn't be read, or nothing said was about it, say only what can be told.
screen: when a decision, question, action or chapter was about something on a screen, the N of that screen, with part: the number of the part meant, if one part is, and sure: true when what was said plainly refers to it ("this chart", "the numbers on the slide"), false when that only seems likely. Otherwise screen is null.

${style.language === 'call' ? 'Write in the language the call was held in. A line or two in another language, such as a stock phrase over a silence, doesn\'t decide it.' : `Write in ${LANGUAGE_NAMES[style.language]}.`} Use only what the transcript and its screens say: never invent names, numbers, dates or decisions. Lines without a name come from a recording in a room, where nobody can tell who spoke. A line starting "--" marks a stretch when notes were off or paused and nothing was recorded: never say or guess what happened in it. Say "they" when you need a pronoun for someone: never guess at anyone's gender from their name. ${DOUBT} When the message lists what's already settled, those stand as the people in the meeting left them: never list them again, even in other words. ${SAID_ONLY}${ticked ?

details: about ${paragraphs} short paragraph${paragraphs === 1 ? '' : 's'} of plain prose, separated by a blank line, following the meeting in order, one topic to a paragraph. For each topic say what was discussed and the main points people made, what they concluded or decided, and what was left open. When a shared screen mattered to a topic (a line "[mm:ss] [screen N" in the transcript), say what it showed, in a few words, as context. Name people as the transcript does, and say "they" when you need a pronoun for someone: never guess at anyone's gender from their name. No headings, lists or markdown. Keep it a summary: the main content, not everything that was said. ${SMALL_TALK} Leave it out: a meeting that was only small talk gets one sentence that says so. Fewer paragraphs when less happened.

You're also sent the notes already written for the meeting (its short summary, decisions, open questions, follow-ups and parts): agree with them, and don't contradict what they say was decided.
