/*
 * Background upkeep (runs every few minutes in the API process):
 *  - removes sessions that have ended;
 *  - purges operation receipts older than 24 hours (they may hold copies of responses);
 *  - retries failed object deletions;
 *  - removes objects older than 24 hours that nothing references (audio, shared-screen video, frame or file writes whose SQL commit failed);
 *  - joins shared screens' video that is still in pieces once the share's tail is over (replay doesn't need the notes service);
 *  - writes notes still waiting (after a restart, or once a retry is due);
 *  - deletes moves to other devices that ran out;
 *  - deletes rings a day after they ran out, in calls that went on that long;
 *  - deletes for good what's been in a workspace's Trash for 30 days, and ends seats whose call is over;
 *  - deletes live notes a call left behind when a release from before them ended it;
 *  - takes away what an upload left when its browser went, a day on, and forgets uploads counted before yesterday.
