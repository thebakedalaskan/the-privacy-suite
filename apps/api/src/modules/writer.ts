/*
 * The notes service (docs: notes-and-inference). When a recording stops, its note is queued in
 * content_jobs with the transcript already in it. A worker claims the job with a lease, has the
 * notes model draft the summary, decisions, open questions, follow-ups, chapters and suggested
 * questions, and each breakout room's own notes from that room's transcript (one request a room),
 * and then writes them into the note, charges the recorded minutes and deletes the job in one
 * transaction. Only then is a call in a series compared with what earlier calls left standing: nothing
 * waits for that, and failing costs only the comparison. A failed attempt is tried again a little
 * later, up to three times; after the third, the note is finished without a summary, so its
 * transcript and any audio are still there. When
 * the notes model's evidence doesn't check out, or can't be checked, nothing was sent: the job waits
 * and checks again, as long as it takes, without using up an attempt. The owner's keys are opened
 * for each job and wiped after it. The organizer can have the notes written again from a corrected
 * transcript (notes.rewrite): the same job, which keeps what people already settled.
