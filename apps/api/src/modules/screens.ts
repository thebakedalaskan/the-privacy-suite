/*
 * Shared screens in a call's notes (docs: Calls and recordings › Shared screens). Call media is end-to-end encrypted,
 * so only browsers see a share. When notes are on, a presenter says whether each share goes in the notes; while one
 * that does is going (and notes aren't paused), the presenter's own browser records it and sends the video in pieces.
 *
 *  - Shares (`screen_shares`): every share started while the call's recording exists, whether it's kept, and when it
 *    started and ended; whose it was is sealed.
 *  - Pieces (`screen_pieces`): each sealed under the recording's key as an object under a random name, like audio.
 *  - Video (`screen_videos`): once the call is over, finishVideo joins each kept share's pieces in each segment into
 *    one video a browser can seek (ffmpeg, pipes only), sealed in 4 MiB chunks so replay opens only what a range
 *    needs, and deletes the pieces. A share whose pieces can't be joined (not video, or failing its integrity check) is
 *    left out of replay and its pieces deleted. A call set not to keep its recording keeps no video either: it stays
 *    only until the notes are written, since the frames are taken from it (purgeVideo).
 *  - Frames (`screen_frames`): JPEGs taken from the video at moments picked from what was said (and so no stretch of a
 *    share goes long without one), each read by the vision model. The notes attach at most one to a transcript line;
 *    the rest only go into what the notes say, and are deleted once they're saved. Notes written before video was kept
 *    have theirs from the presenter's browser, read the same way.
 *
 * Deleting the note deletes all of it, objects included.

/**
 * What a call's kept shares showed while it mattered, for its notes (docs: notes-and-inference › Shared screens). Each
 * step is kept as it's done, so a job tried again carries on where it stopped (`progress`, kept by `save`):
 *
 *  1. The notes model picks the moments what was said points at a screen; selectFrames clamps them into the shares'
 *     video, adds each share's start and end, fills any stretch longer than ten seconds, and caps them at
 *     MAX_SCREEN_FRAMES (picks, kept in the job).
 *  2. One ffmpeg pass per share and segment takes those frames from the sealed video, each with its grey grid; each is
 *     sealed as a frame of the note. A frame of a pick that's already kept isn't taken again; frames kept for picks
 *     there are no longer (notes written again, from a corrected transcript) are left out.
 *  3. The vision model chosen (`chosen`, or the notes model) reads each frame not read by it yet, four at a time, with
 *     the words that picked it and what was said around it, and judges how much it matters. Frames judged unrelated are
 *     left out, and keep their row (read, by this model) so a job tried again doesn't read them again.
 *
 * Nothing is deleted here: the note's current screens keep their frames until new notes are saved, and frames the saved
 * note doesn't show (the ones the notes didn't attach, too) are deleted then, in the same transaction (dropUnused, from
 * writer.settle).
 *
 * Returns the screens for the notes (momentsOf) with their grids, every frame the analysis has (`left`, for
 * dropUnused), the verifications the requests went to, and the model that read the screens. When a model's evidence
 * doesn't check out, or it doesn't answer, that's thrown: the notes wait.
