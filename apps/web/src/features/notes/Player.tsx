/*
 * The private audio behind a note. Each time notes were turned back on, a new segment started; the player plays them
 * one after another as a single recording. Audio is decrypted by the server for a signed-in recipient only, and the
 * browser's own element reads it by byte range: it starts as soon as the first of it arrives and goes to any moment, and
 * whatever was asked of it last is what it does. Until someone presses play, moving along the line reads nothing. A
 * recording has no index to seek by, so going far ahead reads through what's between, once; a browser that won't do that
 * (Firefox stops at what it has already read) gets the segment whole, and plays it from memory. What a URL gives is
 * pinned to a number of pieces, because a browser holds a URL to the length it first said: while a call is recording,
 * reading further is a new URL. The note draws all this as its horizon (CallLine.tsx). Where it's got to changes several
 * times a second, so what shows it reads `pos` through `usePlayerAt`, and the rest of the page isn't drawn again for it.
 *
 * Shares kept for the notes play above it, in step (`Replay`). The audio is the clock: the recording's timeline is the audio
 * segments one after another, which is the timeline the server places shares on, so `pos` is a share's time too. A muted
 * video follows it.
