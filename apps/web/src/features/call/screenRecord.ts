/*
 * Your own shared screen, recorded for the notes (docs: Calls and recordings › Shared screens). Call media is end-to-end
 * encrypted, so only browsers ever see a share: when the presenter said a share goes in the notes, their own browser
 * records it, a few frames a second, and sends it in pieces every five seconds, sealed by the server as they arrive.
 * A share is recorded from the moment it starts, so the notes show it from then, but nothing leaves the browser until
 * it has been up ten seconds: what's recorded before that is held here, and a share that ends sooner is dropped, so a
 * window picked by mistake is never sent.
 *
 * Each recording is one share in one segment of the call's recording: one continuous WebM stream, numbered from piece
 * 0, placed on the same timeline as the call's audio (seconds from the segment's start, as this browser saw it begin).
 * Pausing notes stops it and drops what wasn't sent; resuming starts a new segment, so a new recording. A share ending
 * sends what was recorded before the call is told it ended. Nothing about what's on the screen is logged: only counts,
 * sizes and timings.
