 * no-op, so retries never duplicate audio. The server refuses audio once notes are off, so stopping waits for the last
 * piece before anyone switches notes off.
 *
 * What it records is a mix of voices (a room recording: the microphone; a call: everyone the host's browser
 * hears), through one small audio graph: each voice's own track, as it arrived, faded in when it's heard and out when
 * it isn't, into a limiter so voices over each other don't clip. A voice on a new track (another microphone) carries
 * on in the same recording, and voices come and go mid-segment without the recording stopping: MediaRecorder can't
 * change its input, the graph can. Nobody's volume on this screen, or the speaker chosen, reaches it.
 *
 * Given somewhere to keep pieces (`keep`: the stage recorder's, on this device), a piece that can't be sent (no
 * connection, a failed try, or refused because Alcove's copy of the recording is out of step) is kept there at once
 * instead of lost, to upload later exactly as it is; nothing waits in memory through more tries. After one is kept
 * because sending failed, the next go straight there for a while.
