/*
 * The stage: everyone's tiles, what's shared, the bar that says what's shared or spotlighted, and the captions. It's one
 * layer over the whole of the call's area, so that nothing playing ever remounts as the panels around it (panels.ts) move:
 * tiles sit where the layout engine (stageLayout.ts) puts them and glide there. Your own view (view.ts): drag tiles into
 * another order, make one bigger from its corner, drag the line beside a shared screen, pin people, and see yourself
 * in the grid, in a corner or not at all. Every tile can be focused, then pinned, moved and sized from the keyboard
 * (its ⋯ menu says how). All of that changes your view only. With rooms open, the organizer's stage shows every
 * room; everyone else's shows the people in their own room.
 *
 * Shares shown big have a handle, and the people a small toolbar, to set them apart from the stage as panels of their
 * own. Then they sit where the panels put them: the people as tiles or arches, or small on the horizon beside the dock,
 * where whoever's talking or has a hand up rises.
 *
 * Several people can share at once. Each share names whoever shares it, in the arch; two fit side by side with a line
 * between them, and the rest wait as tiles: a click (or P) shows one big, beside what's big or, when two already are,
 * in place of the one that's been big longest. A share that starts later glows for a moment where the layout puts it:
 * until you choose, a second one goes big beside the first, and once you have, a new one comes in as a tile.
 *
 * Someone else's share you see big can be looked at closer, for you only (ShareSurface.tsx): zoomed, moved around,
 * frozen, stepped back through its last pictures, or opened in its own window, where the stage keeps it as a tile.
 *
 * Anyone the call lets point can point at a share shown big and live here (SharePointing.tsx): their pointer, with their
 * name, and marks that fade, which everyone sees on that share wherever it is on their stage (and in its own window),
 * however they've framed it, while they see it live.
