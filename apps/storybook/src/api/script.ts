/*
 * A call's script: who's in it when you come in, what they say and do and when, how the people you ring answer, and
 * what the call's link says while you wait at the door. The scripted call (call.ts) plays the server's side of it,
 * the scripted room (src/media/livekit.ts) LiveKit's: everyone else's microphones, who's speaking, what they share,
 * and your own connection. A story gives its call a script with `scriptCall` before the call is joined; any other call
 * plays the default one, where everyone invited comes in and talks it through.
 *
 * Times are seconds: in the call, from the moment you joined it (asking to join included); at the door, from when the
 * story opened. Everyone in a script is from the demo world, and everything they say is made up.
