/*
 * CaptureParts: each kind of capture in a call (the recording, the transcript, AI notes and shared screens), what it

 * theme, and `compact`, as a row of small marks, before joining on the night stage. The words follow the call: whose
 * browser takes the notes (`taker`), what that browser can't capture now, AI notes still reading what was transcribed
 * once notes are off, shared screens while they're read, and a breakout room, where nothing is recorded.
