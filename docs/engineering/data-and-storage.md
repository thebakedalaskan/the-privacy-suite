Postgres (`D01`) holds ciphertext plus the minimum clear projection: opaque IDs, keyed hashes, relationships,
states, timestamps, byte counts and sequence numbers. The object store (`O01`: RustFS locally, Cloudflare R2 in
production) holds immutable ciphertext objects under random IDs (`o/<Id128>`). The authoritative schema is
`apps/api/migrations/`, applied in order (`0001_init.sql`, then each file after it); this page explains the
result, and [Changing what's stored](#changing-whats-stored) how it changes without losing anyone's data.

## Tables

| Table | Clear columns | Ciphertext or keyed hash |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `owners` | `owner_id`, `stored_bytes`, `version`, `created_at`, `series_turn_until` (set only while a change to one of the account's series goes through, so changes take turns; [below](#writes-reads-and-deletes)) | `root_envelope` (`Kowner` under `KMASTER`), `root_check` (HMAC). An account or a [workspace](#workspaces) |
| `identities` | owner, created and last used | `subject_index` (primary key), `email_index` (the provider's current email, updated at each sign-in) |
| `sessions` | owner, provider (`google`, `microsoft`, `sso`), created, last seen, expiry | `session_hash` (SHA-256 of the cookie's ID) |
| `items` | owner, item ID, `kind` (`profile`, `meeting`, `note`, `connection`, `series`), current revision, `deleted_at`, `version` | — |
| `revisions` | owner, item, revision, parent revision, `created_at` | `key_envelope`, `manifest_ciphertext` |
| `operations` | owner, operation ID, method, completion time | `request_commitment` (HMAC), `result_ciphertext` |
| `transcript_clips` | owner, note item, when it was heard (so a live view, and the next clip's language and prompt, read only the newest clips; the recording's pieces already show when it was recorded) | `clip_tag` (keyed hash of the clip's segment, start and speaker), `clip_ciphertext` (its segment; in a call, the participant ID of whose speech it was; its transcript lines, each with when it starts and ends, the participant ID of who said it, the breakout room it was said in, if any, while rooms were open who may read it, when it was said, and whether Whisper was unsure of its words; the evidence of the verified model that heard them; the language Whisper picked for it when sure, and whether it asked Whisper what its speaker speaks. A breakout room's clips stay until the call ends, when every clip moves into the note) |
| `transcript_translations` | owner, note item | `line_tag` (keyed hash of the line and the caption language), `translation_ciphertext` (the line in that language) |
| `content_jobs` | owner, job, revision, kind (`notes`), state (`queued`/`writing`), lease, attempt | `job_ciphertext` (the note and recording IDs, and how far it has got with the shared screens: the seconds picked to look at, and those not to take again) |

| `call_notes` | owner, call, part of the call (`place`: `main` or a breakout room's random ID), `view` (`all`, or a digest of the random IDs of the lines this view can't read), how many of the note's clips the last refresh counted, when the last refresh began (`looked_at`), and until when one is under way (`lease_until`) | `notes_ciphertext` (that view's live notes as a catch-up gives them, what they read, who may read all of it, and each follow-up's ID, the lines behind it, and who ticked it and when; null until the first are written) and `lines_ciphertext` (the IDs of the lines it read and when each was said, and when each line it left out was said and who may read it), sealed under the call's notes key, bound to the call, the part and the view. Deleted when the call ends |
| `call_codes` | owner, the item the code leads to (a meeting, or for a series' own link its `series` item) | `code_hash` (keyed hash of the code, so anyone with the link finds the call) |
| `call_moves` | owner, call, move, when it runs out | `secret_hash` (SHA-256 of the move's current secret: the code in the new device's link, then the claim that replaces it), `body_ciphertext` (who's moving, the stage, whether their microphone and camera are on, and the new device's identity, key package and kind, sealed under the call's moves key). Deleted when it runs out, and when the call ends |

Deleted when the person is let in, when the organizer stops ringing them, when the call ends, and a day after it ran out |
| `call_mls` | owner, call, `seq`, MLS group generation, kind (`keypackage`, `commit`, `welcome`, `message`), the random identity a key package came from or a welcome is for, the part of the call whose group an entry belongs to (`grp`: `main` or a breakout room's random ID; none for a key package), epoch | `body_ciphertext` (an MLS message, which the API can't read, sealed again under the call's state key, bound to its place in the log and its part of the call). A breakout room's entries are deleted when it closes; the rest when the call ends, and when a new generation starts (waiting people's key packages carry over) |
| `recordings` | owner, recording, note item, `recording`/`paused`/`stopped`, start (the recording's own, for one made without a connection and uploaded later) and end, `version` | `key_envelope` (`Krec`) |
| `recording_pieces` | owner, recording, segment, seq, where the piece starts in its segment (`at_ms`), object ID, ciphertext SHA-256 and length, duration, codec | (the object) |
| `screen_shares` | owner, recording, share ID (random), whether its presenter put it in the notes (`keep`), when it started and ended (ms into the call, and the recording's segment then) | `meta_ciphertext` (the presenter's participant ID, and who they are as the notes name speakers) |
| `screen_pieces` | owner, recording, share, segment, seq, where the piece starts in its segment (`at_ms`), duration, object ID, ciphertext SHA-256 and length, type | (the object: a piece of a kept share's video, sealed under the recording's key). Deleted once joined into `screen_videos` |
| `screen_videos` | owner, recording, share, segment, chunk, object ID, ciphertext SHA-256 and length, the chunk's plaintext length, the video's length, how many chunks, where it starts in its segment (`at_ms`), duration, type | (the object: at most 4 MiB of the joined video, sealed under the recording's key) |
| `screen_frames` | owner, note item, frame ID, object ID, ciphertext SHA-256 and length | `frame_tag` (keyed hash of the share and the image's digest, so the same image is kept once), `info_ciphertext` (whose share, when, the segment, the frame's size, the moment picked (to a tenth of a second) and why (`reference`, `change`, `question`, `topic`, the share's `start`, or `fill`), the words that picked it, what the vision model read on it, how much it matters, which model read it, and the frame on a 48 × 27 grey grid (`grid`, base64; null on rows from before it was kept) for telling whether the screen changed), and the object (the JPEG, sealed under the recording's key) |

| `personal_notes` | owner (the author), the note's organizer and item: one row for each person and note | `body_ciphertext` (everything they keep on it: what they wrote, bookmarks and what they point at, kept questions and answers, and which of it was added to the shared notes), sealed under the author's own keys. Replaced with each change, with no earlier versions |
| `note_additions` | owner (the note's organizer), note item, addition ID, when it was added | `author_index` (keyed hash of who added it, so deleting their account finds their additions on anyone's notes), `body_ciphertext` (the words, who added it, and the lines or shared screens it points at), sealed under the organizer's keys |
| `billing_accounts` | owner, `version` | `state_ciphertext` (balance and history, under `Kservice`) |
| `workspaces` | owner, `workspace_id` (the public handle, Id128), `version`, when the oldest thing in its Trash went there (`trash_since`), created | `state_ciphertext` (its name and tree: [Workspaces](#workspaces)) |

| `document_updates` | owner (the workspace), document, `seq`, how much it adds in `bytes`, `items` and `nesting`, `deletes_tag` (a keyed hash of what it deletes, so the same deletes again cost no row), created | `update_ciphertext` (one Yjs update and who sent it: [Documents](#documents)) |
| `document_clients` | owner (the workspace), document, `client_id` (a Yjs client: a random number), `next_clock` (how far it's written). Kept as long as the document | `people`: keyed hashes of who it belongs to, by every way access knows them and by their account, each bound to this client and document, so no two rows can be linked. Empty for what the server wrote |

| `presenter_notes` | owner (the account), the document's workspace (`workspace_owner_id`) and `document_id`: one row for each person and document | `body_ciphertext` ([Presenter notes](#presenter-notes)) |
| `workspace_authors` | owner (the workspace), whether this address made the workspace (`made_workspace`) | `email_index`: every address whose name is on something in the workspace, so deleting that account can reach it after it has left |
| `workspace_media` | owner (the workspace), `media_id`, `state` (`uploading`/`ready`), what its pieces take up so far (`bytes`), how many pieces the whole file comes to (`pieces`), created | `info_ciphertext` (its name, type, size and dimensions: [Media](#media)) |
| `workspace_media_pieces` | owner, media, `seq`, object ID, the object's SHA-256 and length | (the object: a sealed piece of the file) |
| `workspace_media_uses` | owner, media, document: which documents and boards have a file | — |
| `media_upload_days` | owner (an account), `day` (UTC), `bytes`: what it uploaded to workspaces that day, for the limit on a day ([Media](#media)) | — |
| `media_guest_upload_days` | `guest_index`, `day` (UTC), `bytes`: what a guest in a call uploaded that day, for the same limit ([Media](#media)) | `guest_index`, a blind index of the person the guest's pass names |

| `object_gc` | object ID, owner, queued time, attempts, last error | — |

The migration runner adds `schema_migrations`, which records each applied file by name.

Constraints: checked domains `alcove_id128` (22 characters) and `alcove_owner_id` (43 characters), composite
owner-scoped foreign keys, and deferred item-head and parent-revision constraints. Deleting an owner cascades to
everything it owns; deleting an item cascades to its revisions, its calls, its recording and pieces, its
transcript clips, its `note_access` or `meeting_access` rows, everyone's `personal_notes` on it and its `note_additions`, and a
meeting's rings go with it. The `note_access` rows that give an account other people's notes belong to those notes'
organizers, so deleting the account deletes them by its email index, unless another account still signs in with that
address; on the same condition, what it answered in `meeting_access` is cleared, and the invite stays with its
organizer. The `call_rings` rows to its address, in other people's calls, go by their own hash and without that
exception. `object_gc` keeps a plain owner ID with no foreign key, so a failed object delete is still retried after its
account is gone. A workspace's tables hang off its `workspaces` row, which
hangs off its `owners` row, so deleting that owner deletes all of it; `document_access` and `workspace_media_uses` rows go
with their document, and a file's pieces and uses with its `workspace_media` row. `document_access.call_id` has no foreign
key, because a call belongs to its organizer, a different owner. `presenter_notes` belongs to both an account and a
document, so it goes with either: by `owner_id`, or by its foreign key to `documents`.

## Manifests (encrypted)

| Item kind | Manifest fields |
| --- | --- |
| `profile` | name, email, photo URL, whether it's a demo account (`sample`), the workspace it used last (`recentWorkspace`), preferences (notes default, notes language, summary length, calendar and offline-recording switches, notification choices, pinned note IDs (at most eight, only notes the person has; pins to notes they no longer have are dropped when preferences are read), groups (a name and up to 50 email addresses each; sharing notes with one carries only its name into the note), and the model that reads shared screens by default (`screenModel`, null for the notes model)), colleagues invited to Alcove |
| `meeting` | title, start, end, guests (email addresses), notes (`on`/`off`), code, status (`scheduled`/`live`/`ended`), the workspace it uses and its agenda there (`workspaceId`, `agenda`: IDs only), duration, note ID (the latest, when it was held more than once; each note names its meeting), when it's on a calendar the Google Calendar event ID and link, whether the event was the organizer's own before it became an Alcove call (adopted), and for a call in a series that repeats, the recurring event it's an occurrence of (`master`), the series it's in (`seriesId`), when that series repeats its link's code (`seriesCode`), for an occurrence of a recurring Google event, that event's ID (`recurringEventId`), which guests were added by being let in from the call's link (`addedFromLink`), once any were, whether it was started now rather than scheduled (`instant`), what the notes keep (`choices`), whether everyone joins muted (`joinMuted`), the documents brought to it by ID, the times offered, until someone picks one (`offer`: the start and end are then those of the first), and while Google is being asked for its event, until when it's claimed for that (`placing`) |
| `note` | kind (`call`/`room`), title, start, duration, meeting ID, recording ID, status (`recording`/`pending`/`ready`), what was worked on in the call (`workedOn`: document IDs, `kind` and who, read for each person by what they can open), invited emails, when the call ended or the recording stopped (when everyone invited got the note), everyone it was shared with afterwards (each address with who shared it: their account ID, name and email as they were then; the name of their group, when it went to one; and when), summary, decisions (text, time, state `proposed`/`confirmed`/`rejected`/`superseded`, the IDs of the lines it rests on and of any that cut against it, who disputes it, changes), open questions (text, time, state `open`/`answered`, the lines it rests on, changes), action items (text, owner when known, whether they took it on, due date as said, done, the lines it rests on, changes; a change says who (account, name and address), how they had the note, when, and what it was before), chapters, gaps (each stretch of the call with notes off or paused: when, and where it falls in the recording), screens (each shared-screen frame the notes attached, at most one a transcript line: where it falls in the recording and until when, the transcript line it's attached to (`line`; null on notes saved before frames were attached to lines), whose share and which, its size, how legible it was, its title, text (up to 700 characters), regions, how much it matters, the words that picked it and what the notes say it shows; the image is in `screen_frames`), the model chosen to read shared screens (`screenModel`), transcript (lines with time, speaker when known, the breakout room by name when said in one, text, what the transcript couldn't vouch for (`unsure`: its words, or who said them), and corrections (`changes`: who changed its words or speaker or said it was heard right, when, and what it was before; the first and the latest 19); null while recording), each breakout room's section (its name, everyone who was in it, when it was open, its gaps, its lines with what the transcript couldn't vouch for and their corrections, and its summary, decisions, open questions, follow-ups and chapters), when the notes last read the transcript to write them (`writtenAt`), suggested questions, breakout rooms (kept with the note, so its chapters include them every time the notes are written), and follow-ups ticked during the call whose notes aren't written yet (`ticked`: each one's ID, words, owner and due date, the IDs of the lines behind it, the room it was in, who ticked it and when; empty in a note stored before calls kept them), what its call was set to keep (`keep`: the transcript and the recording) the seconds of audio recorded (`recorded`, saved when the recording stops, null before then and on a note stopped before it was saved), and what this call came back to from earlier ones in its series (`revisits`: a decision it replaced, by this note's decision, or a question it answered, at a moment and breakout room; each names the earlier note and item by their IDs, and says who said the notes got it wrong, when someone did) |
| `connection` | provider (`google`), the Google refresh token, the scopes granted, when it was connected |
| `series` | a series that was scheduled to repeat: title (the one its calls last got together), how it repeats (`repeat`: the rule, the last day and the organizer's time zone), its link's code, and the recurring Google Calendar event that carries its latest calls, when there is one. Its item ID is the `seriesId` its calls share |

Every save writes a full new revision with a fresh `Krecord` and compare-and-set on the item head
(`409 conflict` if someone else saved first). Reads decrypt the head revision; listing decrypts every live
item of a kind. Earlier revisions stay until the item is deleted: correcting a transcript line or changing a
decision never erases what was there before. The one exception is a note whose call was set not to keep its
transcript: writing its notes deletes every earlier revision, which hold it (`pruneRevisions` in `apps/api/src/vault.ts`).

## Workspaces

A workspace is an **owner**: a row in `owners` with its own root key and a `workspaces` row, so sealing, `owner_id`
scoping and deleting work as they do for an account. It has no `identities` row, session, profile, credits or receipts:
nobody signs in as one, and nothing that reads an account's tables finds it. Nothing lists `owners`. Its `owner_id` stays
on the server; everything outside knows it by `workspace_id`.

Its name and tree are one record, `workspace-state`, under the workspace's key: `name`, and `items`, a map of ID to an
item's `kind` (`document`, `board` or `folder`), `name`, `parent`, `pos`, who made it (`by`: their name and address as they
were, or null when nobody in particular did), `createdAt`, `editedAt`, `trashedAt`, `trashedBy`, `restricted` and
`restrictedBy` (the address of whoever restricted it, when that wasn't its creator). To the tree `kind` is only data: a document and a board are alike, each a row in `documents` that what it holds hangs off, and
nothing here looks inside. A tree is small (at most 5,000 items, and folders at most 32 deep, though nothing that walks one
relies on that: stored data of any depth reads and clears), so one record is enough, and every change is made
under the `workspaces` row's lock, which also serialises changes to its people and who has what: an access check made
under that lock holds until the change commits. The server filters the state for each reader, so nobody is sent a name
they can't open. `pos` is a fractional position, a base-62 string read as a fraction and sorted as plain text, so
something can always land between two siblings without touching either.

**Trash.** `trashedAt` is set on what was sent there; what's in a folder in Trash is there with it, and comes back with
it, except anything that went to Trash by itself earlier. Something restored whose folder isn't in the tree comes back to
the top. A folder takes only what the person sending it there could send by itself: anything they can only read, or can't
see, moves out to where the folder was, the same for deleting it for good, so nobody decides the fate of something they
can't. That goes through the tree once, however much moves. `trash_since` is when the oldest thing there went, so
maintenance finds what's due without opening every workspace. After 30 days it goes for good, as it does at once by Delete
forever: state, then `documents` rows, and what hangs off them. Each workspace is swept in a transaction of its own, and
one that can't be read is logged by its ID and left for next time, so it can't hold up the others.

**What nobody can open.** A restricted document with no creator or restrictor left in the workspace, and nobody it's shared
with, goes to Trash, whenever that happens: someone taken out, an entry removed, a seat ended. Nobody who could decide its
fate can see it, so it isn't deleted then, and it isn't given to anyone. If its creator comes back within 30 days they
find it there and can restore it. Otherwise it goes as anything in Trash does.

**People.** `workspace_members` and `document_access` find people by keyed hash and seal who they are beside it, in the
same row, so taking someone out takes their address with them. `workspace_authors` keeps the hash of every address whose
name is on something here, which is how deleting an account finds a workspace it left long ago. When a sign-in brings an
account a new address, everything under the old hash moves to the new one in that sign-in's transaction, and its name on
what it made follows. A workspace holds at most 1,000 people, a document is shared with at most 500, and an address can
have made at most 100 workspaces. Who can do what is in
[Privacy › Who can open a workspace](privacy-keys-and-sessions.md#who-can-open-a-workspace).

### Documents

What a document or board holds is a Yjs document: a CRDT, so people can type at once, offline or not, and always end up
with the same thing. Browsers exchange binary updates through the API, which seals each and keeps it. Only
`apps/api/src/modules/documentText.ts` knows what's inside one, and it goes by `kind`, so a board says its own words;
everything else below is the same for anything that holds a Y.Doc. A document's blocks are the root fragment `content`,
its comment threads the root map `comments`, and the editor's schema decides the rest.

Yjs trusts what it's given, and what's in a document comes from browsers. So nothing here is taken on trust: an update is
checked before it's stored ([what gets in](#what-gets-into-a-document)), a document is only ever opened in a worker
([opening one](#opening-a-document)), and nothing is deleted until what replaces it is proved to open.

- **Starting.** A new document has its title and first line before anyone opens it, each with an empty text in it: the
  seed, one fixed Yjs update that browsers and the API share (`DOC_SEED` in `@alcove/api`), is written as its snapshot when
  the item is made. A browser that can only read never has to write, two people opening a new document find one title, and
  two people typing there first type in the same text. A board starts with nothing. A
  copy starts from the seed under the workspace's lock, and what the original holds becomes its first update afterwards,
  outside it, one document at a time, with a document's title changed to say what the tree calls the copy. A copy holds only
  each map key's last value, since nobody can be behind it. If the workers stay busy it waits about 15 seconds and then
  fails, and the copy is deleted for good, so nobody's left with a blank one that looks like the real thing. A document whose records
  won't open still leaves its copy as it started, and the rest are made all the same.
- **Updates** go up as bytes (`application/octet-stream`), as big as a document can be, and are sealed and appended in one
  transaction, under the workspace's row lock for reading (so nothing lands after someone loses access) and the `documents`
  row's lock. `seq` comes from `next_seq` under that lock, so rows commit in order, and whoever has read past a `seq` has
  missed nothing before it. `pg_notify` goes out on commit. An update that arrives twice is known by its clocks and stored
  once, so a retried request does no harm and nothing keeps a receipt.
- **What's sent to whoever opens it** is a state, not the history: the log goes through a Y.Doc, which keeps only that
  something was deleted, so a word someone took out isn't sent to the next person who opens the document. That's also why
  compaction doesn't use `Y.mergeUpdates`, which keeps deleted content. A browser that's been here before says how far it got
  (`after`) and is sent what it's missing the same way, or nothing at all if nothing changed, or everything if a compaction
  has passed the point it got to. Whichever it is, it merges.
- **Compaction.** Past 200 updates or 1 MiB since the last snapshot, the log folds into `document_snapshots` and the rows
  it covers go. All but the newest update: streams are reading that one. The work happens after the update commits and
  outside any lock, because what's in the log up to a `seq` never changes; the row's lock is taken only to swap the snapshot
  in, and only if the snapshot is still the one it started from, so two instances folding at once write one. What it made is
  opened again in the worker, and has to reach everything the log did, before a row is deleted. A row that won't decrypt stops
  it: that may be a key that's wrong, not a row that's bad, and folding past it could lose it for good. A failure is logged
  with its IDs and tried again a minute later: nothing about compaction can fail an update.
- **Versions.** The first update after ten minutes of editing keeps what was there before it, so a version closes a stretch
  of work: a whole state, which opens whatever happens to the log afterwards, sealed in parts of 256 KiB, with who changed the
  document since the last one. Reading one streams those parts in order, so a reader holds one at a time however slowly they
  take them: 8 reads at once on an instance (`DOC_VERSION_READS`), 60 a minute per person, and whoever hasn't taken a part
  within a ping is let go of. One is kept when a call ends too (`keepVersion`, labelled with the call, for History to group by), unless nothing
  changed, and before a restore. A document keeps up to 64 MiB of them, the oldest going past that, and always its newest.
  Nothing goes for being one of many: an old version is often the last to hold words deleted since, and telling which would
  mean opening every one, so only the byte budget prunes. Nothing that changes nothing makes a version.
- **Restoring** makes the document what it was, for everyone, as one update like any other. Yjs only moves forward, so going
  back means writing again what was deleted and taking out what was added: what happened since the version is replayed onto
  it and undone, which works for anything a Y.Doc holds, roots included. A block added since is emptied and left, not deleted,
  the way the editor retires one (`@alcove/api/retire`), so words someone typed in it offline bring it back when they arrive.
  What it says now is kept as a version first, and nothing lands between that and the restore: a mark on the row (`held_until`)
  turns updates away with `503` until it's done, and browsers try again, so whatever's undone is in a version. It's a mark and
  not the row's lock because a big document takes a while, and everyone typing would each hold a connection. A restore that
  would leave the document past its limit is refused. The tree's name follows the title, because a browser renames only what
  it types.
- **Size.** What's on a document's page stops at 150,000 items (`MAX_DOC_ITEMS`, `DOC_ITEMS_MAX`), about 37,500 lines, or
  16 MiB. An item is one Yjs struct that isn't deleted and isn't in a retired block, so a line is about four, and a page someone
  emptied has room again. One rule holds at the limit: an update goes in if it doesn't add to what's on the page, counting what
  it adds against what it deletes and retires. So deletes, a block leaving the page, joins and moves all go through, whole, and
  nothing ever needs sending apart; anything that adds is `413 too-large`, and the browser's status says `failed`, `too-large`.
  Bytes go the same way, by what's said on the page, since a move adds a little structure every time. Typing on at the end of
  a line adds bytes and not items, as Yjs merges it into what's there. The figures on the row are the most the page could come
  to, so most updates are judged on those alone; one they can't settle is weighed exactly, by a worker that opens the document
  and applies it (`weigh`). Nobody's words are lost: they stay in the browser that typed them.
- **What it can hold.** Everything a document holds costs memory, on the page or not, so there are ceilings past which only
  deletes are taken: 300,000 items on the page and 32 MiB, which only two updates racing come near, and 450,000 structs in all.
  That third counts what Yjs has to keep: tombstones, retired blocks, and every value a map key has ever had. A value that's
  been overwritten stays a struct for good, at about 350 bytes of memory and 10 stored, and these don't merge across keys, so
  1,000,000 writes to the keys of 5,000 objects left 1,090,000 structs, 95,000 of them live. No compaction can let them go: a
  browser that's behind holds part of a key's chain and needs the rest to find what's current, and given a state without it,
  the key comes back empty. Only a copy, which has nobody behind it, starts without them. So a store that writes the same
  things over and over keeps them in a list, not in map keys: one shared `Y.Array` of entries, where each write deletes the old
  entry and pushes a new one (y-utility's `YKeyValue`). What's deleted there merges, at most one struct a batch: the same
  1,000,000 writes left 2 structs with one person, and about 5,000 with people taking turns. A document that does reach a
  ceiling still opens, and loses nothing, and carries on in a duplicate.

  Measured through the real pool with production's worker limits, with the heaviest kind of item, a nested map, on the page:
  150,000 of them with history up to 450,000 structs folds, opens and copies in 400 MiB, so a document at its limits has more
  than a third of the big worker's 640 MiB (`DOC_HEAP_MB`) to spare. At both ceilings at once, 300,000 on the page and 450,000
  in all, it folds in 640 and not in 480; 600,000 still folds, and 750,000 doesn't, which is why the ceiling is where it is.
  A real block holds about 650 to 1,000 bytes an item once it's open.
- **Reading it on the server.** Nothing on the event loop opens a document, so other modules ask by name: `readDocument(w, id,
  'todos', { kind })`, and `writeDocument(w, id, 'retitle', { name }, { by, callId, holding })`, which goes through the same log,
  so what the server writes reaches browsers as an update. `apps/api/src/modules/documentOps.ts` holds what can be asked: a
  plain function of the document and plain data, one line each, which a worker can import. `searchText` streams everything
  someone can open as blocks of words, one document a line, for searching in their browser, and stops as soon as they can't
  read what's next. Text is one element, `line`, with a `kind`; a block is retired instead of deleted, so an edit landing in one
  is never lost. `isGone` in `@alcove/api/retire` is the one rule for what's on the page, for the editor and the server alike:
  a retired block still holding something reads like any other.
- **A known limit in Yjs.** Undoing the delete of an element that holds text two people typed into at once can write an item
  whose left origin is to the right of its right origin (`redoItem`). It applies, states agree, and nothing can tell, but a word
  comes out scrambled, the same for everyone: 25 runs in about 13,000 random ones, and none in over 12,000 where no element
  was deleted. `proveOpens` can't see it. Blocks are retired and never deleted, which avoids it for them. Table rows and a board's
  objects are deleted, so they could reach it, by reasoning rather than a run. It's upstream, and nothing here can catch it.
- **What won't open** stops only itself. A row that won't apply or won't decrypt is left out and logged, and the document
  is served without it. One that can't be opened at all, in the time or memory a worker has, is marked closed for five
  minutes (`closed_until`, so a restart doesn't try again, and neither does a tab), with a warning naming the IDs: its
  stream says `closed`, `unavailable`, as its only line. The same goes for what the server does itself: `readDocument`,
  `writeDocument` and compaction cost no worker on a closed document, and any of them that proves too much, out of a worker's
  time or memory, closes it, so a poll can't keep a worker on one however many people are polling. A worker that only says a
  job failed closes nothing: a compaction that won't pass a row it can't read is one, and the document opens without that row. Its versions still read, and restoring one replaces what won't open
  and ends everyone's stream, since there's nothing to merge with. Updates to it are still taken: nothing's refused for a
  document that may only be slow. What the server does to it for itself, reading, writing, compacting and searching it, costs
  no worker while it's closed, and a job of those that runs out of time or memory closes it too. One that fails closes
  nothing: a fold won't go past a row it can't read, and the document still opens without that row.

### What gets into a document

`apps/api/src/modules/documentFirewall.ts` reads every update before it's stored, byte by byte, and builds nothing from it.
It goes by Yjs's structs and never by what a document means, so a board goes through the same door as a page. Whoever can't
write there hears so first, before anything of it is read. Refused means a reason in the log and no row, and a browser hears
which kind it was: `400 invalid` for what no honest client could send, and `413 too-large` for what's only too much, which
taking something out can change.

What can be told from the update alone is checked with nothing held, in a worker past 32 KiB:

- Nothing of zero length, no `Skip`, no sub-documents, nothing after the end, values at most 64 deep, and only JSON that
  Yjs can write back. Yjs's own decoder lets several of these past, and a zero-length struct applies, then makes a snapshot
  nobody can read. A `GC` is fine as long as it holds something: a browser sends one when something's made and deleted in
  one transaction.
- As many structs as a document can hold, from any number of clients, so nothing fits in a document and not in an update, and
  1,024 items with the same left neighbour, which is what makes Yjs's conflict scan quadratic. The cap can't be on a shared
  right neighbour: every key typed mid-line shares one. These, and types nested too deep in one update, are `too-large`.
- Everything in it can be placed: it's worked through as Yjs would, and anything that waits for what it can't ever have is
  refused, because Yjs would carry it pending for ever, in every snapshot.

What depends on the log is checked under the document's lock, against `document_clients`, without opening the document:

- Structs only for clients this person owns. The first to write as a client has it, and a person is known by every way
  access knows them, and by their account, so someone who signs in during a call keeps theirs, and so does someone whose
  address changes, in an open tab or with words kept offline. A client's row takes on whatever else its writer goes by each
  time they write, so a row from before accounts were counted carries forward. Nobody can write as someone else, which is
  what a forged clock would need: Yjs would believe it, and everything that client wrote next would vanish.
- Clocks carry on from where a client got to, with no gap, or go over what's there, as a retry does. An update whose structs
  are all here already is a retry, or something a browser rebuilt: only its deletes are kept, and none of its structs are
  counted again. Deletes the log has had since its snapshot, known by a keyed hash, are nothing: no row, and no version.
- Origins, right origins and parents are clocks that exist, or arrive with this. That's anything before or after what the
  update brings of a client, too: two tabs share a store, so an old part of a client can go with something built on a later
  part, which the log has by now. Deletes reach only clocks that exist.
- A running count of items and of how deep types nest: deleting a type recurses into it, in every browser, so nesting stops
  at 1,024. Depth can't be seen from an update, so it's counted as if everything nested below the deepest thing there, and a
  compaction, which walks the document, puts the figure right.

### Opening a document

Yjs has no limit on what opening a document can cost, and a shape that takes minutes can't always be told from one that
doesn't without the whole document. So every Y.Doc on the server is in a worker thread (`live/docPool.ts`, `modules/documentWork.ts`):
loading, merging, compacting, encoding a `sync`, restoring, searching, and anything `readDocument` or `writeDocument` asks.
Sealed rows go in with the document's key, which is wiped when the job ends, and sealed bytes and plain data come out, so big
records are opened and sealed there too.

There are 2 workers (`DOC_WORKERS`), each job has 20 seconds (`DOC_WORK_MS`), and the first worker, which takes documents past
256 KiB or 25,000 items one at a time, has 640 MiB (`DOC_HEAP_MB`) and the others 96. An update past 4 MiB is sealed and read
there too, since it goes through a few copies as text. A worker that runs out of either fails that one job. It's replaced when
it's next needed, and the event loop never noticed. A worker with nothing to do for 30 seconds goes, which gives its memory
back, and one that's held a big document goes after a second.

People take turns. Each has a line of their own, or a workspace for what nobody in particular asked for, and a free worker
goes to the next person in turn with nothing running, so someone opening a document waits behind one job, however much anyone
else has asked for. What a lock is waiting on goes first. A document that takes a second or more is treated as big for ten
minutes, whatever its size says, so slow documents stay off the other workers. At most 256 jobs and 128 MiB can wait, and of
that 32 jobs (`DOC_WAITING_PER_PERSON`) and 32 MiB for one person: past either, the browser is told to try again. Searching
honours a document being closed, and one that takes more than a worker has is closed for everyone, as it is for opening it.

What's on its way to browsers is counted before anything's opened, and stays counted until the last of it has left or the
reader has: a document opening, each line of its stream, a version, a search. At most 64 MiB on an instance
(`DOC_SENDING_MB`), and a quarter of that for one person or one address, past which opening a big document waits for the
browser to try again, and a stream with a line there isn't room for is let go of, for its browser to open it again from where
it got to. Someone with nothing on its way is held back only by the instance's limit, and with nothing at all on its way
anything goes, however big. Anything under 256 KiB always goes, so nobody's unread streams hold up anyone's ordinary document.
Everything big goes in pieces of 64 KiB, each only once the last has left: a write is over when the connection has it, not the
browser, so written whole it would sit in memory for as long as nobody read it. A reader who hasn't taken a piece within a ping,
or takes something big slower than 128 KiB a second, is let go of. At most 128 MiB of updates can be coming in at once, past
what's small enough to be typing.

### Presenter notes

What someone keeps beside a document for presenting it: one `presenter_notes` row for each account and document, sealed
under the account's own keys (state key `presenter-notes:<documentId>`, record kind `presenter-notes`, whose header binds
the account, the workspace and the document), so nobody else who can open the document can read them, and a record copied to
another row doesn't open. `GET` and `POST /v1/workspaces/:id/documents/:doc/presenter-notes`, for anyone who can open the
document and has an account: someone in a call by its link has nowhere to keep them (`403`). Empty text deletes the row. At
most 20,000 characters.

### In a browser

`DocSession` (`packages/api-http`) owns the `Y.Doc` and runs the same in a browser and in Node. Edits gather for 150 ms and go
one request at a time, the oldest first, as much as fits in one; a retry only ever repeats what the API may not have.
Nothing typed is let go of until the API has it, and with a `keep` store (the app's is sealed under the device key) that
survives a reload: what's kept is applied when the session starts and sent when there's a connection. The stream picks up from
the last `seq` it heard, however it ended, and never moves on from what this browser sent, only from what the stream
said. Being able to only read, or it going to Trash, stops sending until an `access` line says otherwise.

A refusal never lets go of anything. What's refused stays in memory and in `keep`, through reloads, and the status says so:
`unsent` is true until Alcove has everything or someone chooses to let it go, and `saved` only ever means that.
`unsentCopy()` gives the words this browser wrote that Alcove hasn't taken, and nothing else, as plain paragraphs: what's on the
page in page order, a paragraph to a line, then what Yjs has nowhere to put, read from what it's holding, in the order it was
written. It reads them by the clocks the waiting updates bring, so nothing anyone else wrote, nothing that went, and nothing
deleted is in it: a new document made of it can't carry what someone can't open any more, or deleted. The app makes that
document with `saveCopy` (`POST …/adopt`, which needs an account, as making that document does, accepts only a document
nobody's written to, and judges what it's given like
anything from a browser), then calls `discardUnsaved(token)`, the only thing that forgets what Alcove doesn't have: what the
copy holds that can't reach this document, refused, with the session over, or with only reading allowed now, and nothing written since, nothing that can still
go, and nothing another tab keeps. It closes the session, whose `Y.Doc` still holds what was let go of; opened again, what's
still kept goes, or comes back to be saved if it was written on what was let go of. A document that's deleted while someone
has unsent words works the same way.

An update that's refused can't hold up what's behind it. A client's clocks have to reach the API in order, so everything
written as that client is stuck with it: the session moves to a new client, and what's written next goes as usual, unless it
builds on what's stuck, which waits too. It only moves four times in one stretch, as a client costs the API a row for good:
after that what's written waits with the rest, without a request for each batch. What's stuck is worked out afresh in a scratch
document, a second after anything changes, then after 3, 6, 12, 24 and every 30 seconds, and as soon as `edit` access returns:
nothing's keeping what was deleted for undo there, so a paste that's been undone or cut down is a small thing now, and goes in
place of everything that was waiting, whole: a change is never split, so a move can't arrive as a delete. Of what's deleted it
says only what Alcove may not have, never all that's ever been deleted. That holds through a reload. Only what was in what went
is let go of: anything Yjs couldn't place stays, and says `rejected`, and nothing's written for it until something changes, as
does anything Alcove refuses outright. A browser shouldn't ever see that, and what doesn't depend on it carries on regardless.

`KeptUpdate` says when each edit was made (`at`). Nothing reads that yet: retired blocks can't be pruned while someone may
still be offline with words for one, and nothing in this release prunes them or limits how long someone can stay offline.
`document()` is async, because Yjs loads with the first document someone opens and stays out of everything else.

### Media

A file is anything someone puts in a document or on a board: a picture, video, audio or anything else. It belongs to the
workspace, as a row in `workspace_media`, and is reached only through a document that has it, a row in
`workspace_media_uses`, because a guest's seat covers one document: a seat reaches that document's files and no others
([Privacy › Files](privacy-keys-and-sessions.md#files)). The API seals uploads, as it seals everything: a file reaches the
process readable and is sealed there (`apps/api/src/modules/media.ts`).

- **What's kept.** A `workspace-media` record: its name, type, size, and its width and height where the browser knew them.
  And its bytes, in pieces of exactly 4 MiB but the last, each a `media-piece` binary record in an object under a random name,
  a couple of hundred bytes over its own size ([Privacy › Records](privacy-keys-and-sessions.md#records-and-envelopes)). All of
  it is sealed under the file's own state key, `media:<id>`. At most 512 MiB a file, unless that's changed (below).
- **Its type.** What a browser calls a file is kept only if it can be shown in place: JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF and AVIF
  pictures, MP4 and WebM video, and MP3, M4A, WebM and Ogg audio, by any of the names browsers use for them. Anything else is
  kept as `application/octet-stream`, and only ever downloads, under the name it came with. SVG and HTML are in that group:
  nothing shown in place can run.
- **Going up.** `POST /v1/workspaces/:id/documents/:doc/media` says what's coming, for someone with `edit` on the document,
  and makes the row and its use. Each piece goes to `…/media/:media/pieces/:seq` as bytes, exactly its own length: sealed,
  written to the object store, read back and checked (length and SHA-256), and only then recorded, under the workspace's
  lock with access asked again, so someone who lost the document while a piece was on its way keeps nothing and its object
  goes. A piece is kept by its place in the file, so sending it again changes nothing. `…/finish` makes the file readable
  once every piece is there; until then nobody can read, list or reuse it. Every piece counts towards the workspace's
  `stored_bytes`, once, however many documents have the file.
- **Going wrong.** The client tries a piece again: for up to 5 minutes through a lost connection or a busy server, which
  pass by themselves, picking up as soon as the browser says it's back online, so a Wi-Fi handover doesn't start 500 MiB
  over; and 3 times more after a failure on the server. Past that, or if the browser gives up, it takes back what got there
  (`DELETE …/media/:media`). An upload whose browser went stays `uploading` until maintenance takes it, a day on.
- **What can be kept.** Three limits, which change without a deploy and are in force everywhere within
  30 seconds ([Deployment › Changing a limit](deployment-and-acceptance.md#changing-a-limit)): a file, 512 MiB; what a workspace
  stores, its `stored_bytes`, 100 GiB; and what one person uploads in a day (UTC), in every workspace together, 20 GiB. They're the
  same for everyone, guests in a call included. Each is checked when an upload starts, with the whole file, and again on every
  piece, so uploads going at once pass one by the pieces on their way and no more. A file over the limit is refused as `400
  invalid`, with how big one can be, "This file is bigger than 512 MiB, the most a file can be.", because only the server
  knows; a full workspace with `409 conflict`, "This workspace is full, so it can’t take more files."; and a day used up with
  `409 conflict`, "That’s all you can upload today. You can upload more tomorrow." A limit of zero refuses everything with
  "Files can’t be uploaded right now." Lowering a limit refuses what comes next and deletes nothing. An account's day is counted in `media_upload_days` as its pieces are kept, and
  a guest's, who has no account, in `media_guest_upload_days`, by a blind index of the person their pass names: either way every
  instance counts the same day, and a restart forgets nothing. A piece
  that takes a workspace or someone's day past 80% of its limit logs it at warn, once each time it's crossed.
- **Reuse.** `attach` puts a file in another document of the workspace, for someone who can edit that document and can
  already reach the file, and a copy of a document has what the original has, in the transaction that makes it. It's still one
  file: nothing more is stored.
- **Reading.** `GET …/media/:media/token` gives whoever can open the document a token, and `GET /v1/media/:token` reads the
  file, because a picture or a player can't send a header ([Privacy › Files](privacy-keys-and-sessions.md#files)). Pieces are
  read in order, each digest checked before it's opened, with `Range`, `nosniff`, `no-store` and the type from the sealed
  info, never the request. An answer to a range sends at most four pieces (16 MiB), stopping where a piece does, and says
  so with its `Content-Range`: a browser asks again for the rest, and access is asked about again each time. Read without a
  range, a file over 16 MiB streams without a length, because Cloud Run refuses an HTTP/1 response that says it's over 32
  MiB, and asks again every four pieces. The first piece is read before anything is sent, so its failure is an ordinary
  answer; a later one breaks the connection, so a file that couldn't be read is never taken for whole.
- **Pictures.** A board or a document shows a picture through `api.workspaces.media.picture`, which reads it into an object
  URL: at most 4 at once for a browser, trying again for minutes when the server's busy. A room of people opening the same
  board at once would otherwise overrun what the process takes on, and an `<img>` can't try again. Video and audio use the URL,
  which a player reads by range.
- **What a process takes on.** Every call runs in the same one process, so what a file can hold there is limited
  (`MEDIA_LIMITS` in `modules/media.ts`). At most 16 pieces are coming in at once, 4 for any one person, counted from before
  their bodies are read; past that they're refused with `503 unavailable` and the client tries again. A piece has to keep
  coming: one that brings less than 256 KiB in 10 seconds, stopped or only trickling, is cut, and the client tries again. At
  most 32 reads are open, 8 for any one person, from when they start until their response has gone, whether it finished or the
  browser left. A piece goes out in slices of 256 KiB and the next is opened only when the last has gone, so a reader who stops
  holds one piece at most. A read past that waits in line, holding nothing: at most 48 of them, 24 for one person, for 10
  seconds, and then it's refused too. A read that waited asks who's asking again, and opens nothing if its browser has gone.
- **A read that stops.** While someone's in line, a read that has taken nothing for 5 seconds gives way to them, the longest
  stopped first, and someone at their own limit gets one of their own back. Being cut costs a paused video nothing: it asks
  again from where it got to when it plays. With nobody in line a stopped read is left alone. Every read ends at 280 seconds
  (`MEDIA_READ_MS`) whatever it's doing, under Cloud Run's timeout, so nothing holds a place for good.
- **The core.** Reading and writing share one budget, however many people are doing it. 4 pieces are in hand at once, and
  their sealing, opening and hashing take turns, one at a time, each followed by a pause of seven times what it took: an eighth
  of the core, and about a third of what a piece costs the process, so a call keeps more than half of it. A piece's cost is
  timed, so this holds on a slower core. Past that, pieces wait, and reads run into the limits above. Each piece opened also
  counts against someone's 240 reads a minute, because a byte costs a whole piece.
- **Going away.** Taking a block out of a document leaves its file there, for a version or for reuse: a use goes only when
  its document is deleted for good, so a version or something in Trash keeps its pictures. A file nothing uses any more goes
  in the same transaction: its rows go, stored bytes fall to match, and its objects are queued in `object_gc` there too, so
  a process that stops straight after the commit strands nothing. They're deleted straight after it, and what the store
  refuses stays queued for maintenance. Use rows only change under the workspace's lock: adding one shares the lock and
  taking one away holds it alone, so a file can't be given out as it goes.
- **Deleting one.** `DELETE …/media/:media` deletes a file for good, the same way, for anyone who can edit a document that has
  it: every use goes with it. They have to be able to edit every document that has it, whether they can open it or not, or
  it's `forbidden`: reusing a picture doesn't make it yours to delete, and nobody's file goes from a document you were never
  shown. One you can't open is refused in the same words as one you can only read, "This file is also in a document you can’t
  edit.", so it names neither. Someone who can edit the document only through a seat in a call is refused too, as `forbidden`:
  a seat is for working on it in the call, and taking the file's block out of it still works. A version or another document
  that still shows it gets `not-found` from then on, as for any file that isn't there, and the app shows it as removed.

### Live traffic

Live traffic is NDJSON down and `POST` up: a guest authenticates with a header, which a browser's WebSocket can't send,
and this way it runs through the same auth, origin check and tests as everything else.

- **The hub** (`apps/api/src/live/hub.ts`). Anything that changes a workspace calls `publish(db, workspaceId, notice)` in its
  own transaction, so `pg_notify` goes out on commit and not on a rollback. Each API instance runs one hub with one
  `LISTEN` connection of its own, made when someone first subscribes, which hands each notice to whoever subscribed to that
  workspace on this instance, its own notices included. A notice carries IDs or something sealed, never anything
  readable, and at most 7,900 bytes. A connection can go quiet without closing, so the hub asks it something every 15
  seconds and gives it 5 to answer. If it goes, or doesn't answer, it comes back by itself, waiting 250 ms up to 5 seconds,
  and everyone subscribed hears `missed`, because notices sent meanwhile are gone. It needs a direct connection to
  Postgres: `LISTEN` doesn't work through a transaction-mode pooler.
- **How many.** `hub.admit` counts each person's open streams on each instance, with one limit for each kind of stream: 8
  of a workspace and 8 of documents. All of them from one client address stop at 64 (`LIVE_STREAMS_PER_ADDRESS`), because
  accounts are free, which is about 32 people behind one office's address with a workspace and a document open, and everyone's together at 500 an instance (`LIVE_STREAMS_MAX`), because each holds one of the requests
  an instance can take at once, and rings and calls need them too. The next is refused with `503 unavailable` rather
  than closing the oldest, so a stream at work is never taken from anyone, and that's decided before anything is read. The
  browser tries again by itself and gets in when one closes.
- **A workspace's stream** (`GET /v1/workspaces/:id/live`). Lines: `tree`, whole, first and whenever what this reader sees
  changes; `presence`, everyone here that they can know of, whole, whenever that changes; `access`, when their role changes,
  just before the `tree` that shows it; `ping`, every 25 seconds; `closed`, when
  they can't open it any more, and it ends. Every stream of a workspace on an instance shares one subscription and one
  read of each change, for the streams behind it: `version` moves on with every change to the tree or to who has what, and
  a notice that finds nobody behind stops at that one small query. The read takes the state and what those readers have,
  under keys opened for it and not kept. Each stream then works out what its reader sees, and sends nothing if that's what
  they last saw, which it knows from a hash: a stream holds no tree, because a copy for each is what runs an instance out of
  memory. A slow browser skips to the latest.
- **A document's stream** (`GET /v1/workspaces/:id/documents/:doc/live?after=<seq>`). First `sync`: what this browser
  doesn't have as one update, the `seq` that reaches, and what they can do. Then `update`, in order; `awareness`; `access`,
  when their role changes or it goes to Trash or comes back; `ping`; and `closed`, saying why it's over: `access`, `deleted`,
  `session` or `unavailable`. Up: `POST …/updates`, `POST …/awareness`, and, with an account, `POST …/adopt` for a new document's first state ([In a browser](#in-a-browser)). A notice is `<document>:<seq>`, and each is read once on
  each instance, by the document's room, which keeps the lines not everyone has been told, each made once. Rows are read before
  how far the snapshot reaches, and it's the rows that say what a compaction took: seqs have no gaps until one makes them, and
  anyone who hadn't been told what's gone starts again from where they got to. A stream keeps only its place: nothing of
  the document stays with it once its `sync` is written, so 500 of them cost little. A stream that falls more than 256
  updates or 1 MiB behind is let go of, and its browser picks up from its last `seq`. Hearing that the hub missed something
  reads again from there too. Someone who loses a document hears nothing written after that: a change to who has what
  that was heard first is settled before the update behind it is read.
- **Carets** (awareness) are never stored. A browser's state goes up at most every 100 ms and travels through a notice sealed
  under the workspace's key, at most 4 KiB, and every instance passes it on. It takes having the document open on that
  instance: a stream hears of every change to who has what, so a caret needs no looking up of its own, and opens no tree. Anyone
  else gets the same `404` as for a document that isn't there, except that someone's own caret can always say it's going. The server writes who it is over `user` in the
  state: `{ id, name, callIdentity }`, an `id` that's a keyed hash, the same for that person everywhere in the workspace, and never
  an address. Nothing a browser says about itself survives that, and a client someone else has been using is refused, so
  nobody can take over another person's caret. Nothing keeps carets for whoever arrives, so someone arriving says so, and
  everyone who hears from someone new says where they are.
- **Presence** is never stored either. Opening a workspace's stream puts a browser here; it says where it is (`POST
  /v1/workspaces/:id/presence`) when that changes and every 10 seconds, which travels sealed the same way, and every
  instance keeps what it hears in memory until it's said again. 30 seconds of silence and it's gone (`LIVE_PRESENCE_MS`), or at
  once when the browser says it's leaving. Someone can only be placed in what they can open, and every change to who has
  what is checked against everyone here. What each reader is told is worked out for them: where someone is if they can open
  it, otherwise `elsewhere`, with the document and block null. Someone outside the workspace hears of nobody who isn't in something
  they can open or in a call with them, and an address goes only between people in the workspace. `callIdentity` goes
  only to people in that call, so a tile can show where someone is. Streams work out who's here at most five times a second.
- **Who's reading is checked again** at every ping, on the clock, however busy the workspace is, from the session and pass
  the stream came with. For a session it's one indexed read and nothing of the workspace; a pass takes the call's state,
  and only people in a call have one. A session or pass that ended, a person out of the call, all end it, within 25 seconds
  at most. A notice about the workspace does it at once. A stream that finds nothing left for its reader first asks who
  they are now, because a new address from their provider moves what they have to another hash.
- **Letting go.** A stream ends without `closed` when the API lets go (after 280 seconds, inside Cloud Run's 300-second
  request timeout, so it's never cut) or its instance shuts down. The browser opens it again: quietly when it just ended,
  showing `reconnecting` when it failed, keeping what it last showed either way. A line that can't be written within a ping
  ends a stream too, which is how one whose browser went as it opened is let go of. A browser that hears nothing for a
  minute takes the connection for dead.

## Writes, reads and deletes

- **Audio pieces** are sealed with the recording's `Krec`, written to the object store, read back and checked
  (length and SHA-256), and only then recorded in SQL, holding the recording's row: one that arrives once the
  recording has stopped is refused. A failed, refused or duplicate write queues the object for deletion.
- **Streaming** a segment reads pieces in order, checks each digest, decrypts, and streams. Only for the note's
  organizer or someone with a `note_access` row for it, with an allow-listed content type, `nosniff` and
  `no-store`.
- **Transcript clips** are sealed under the note's transcript key, one row per transcribed clip (its lines,
  none if nothing survived the filter), with the evidence of the verified model it went to. The live call or
  recording state opens them all; stopping moves the lines, and each distinct verification, into the note's
  manifest and deletes the rows in the same transaction. A note's manifest keeps those verifications, and the
  notes model's, as `inference` ([Notes and inference › What a note keeps](notes-and-inference.md#what-a-note-keeps)).
- **Caption translations** are sealed under the same transcript key, one row per line and language, and are
  deleted with the transcript clips when the recording stops.
- **Live notes** are sealed in `call_notes`, one row for each view of each part of the call that has had some, opened with
  every read of the call and written at most every 30 seconds and with each tick. A refresh is claimed and saved under the row's
  lock and runs with nothing held, so the model's answer never holds up the call. When the call ends, what was ticked
  moves into the note's manifest and the rows go, in the same transaction
  ([Notes and inference › Live notes](notes-and-inference.md#live-notes)).
- **Shared screens' video.** Each share started while the call's recording exists gets a `screen_shares` row.
  A piece of a kept share's video is sealed under the recording's `Krec` (record kind `screen-video`, binding the
  recording, share, segment, piece and object), written to the object store, read back and checked, and only
  then recorded in `screen_pieces`; a piece sent again is stored once, and one whose row doesn't commit queues its
  object for deletion. Once the call is over and the share's tail has passed (a timer set as the call ends, and maintenance as a backstop; no notes service is needed) each share's pieces in each segment are joined into one
  video, sealed in chunks of at most 4 MiB (`screen-video-chunk`, binding the chunk and the count) into
  `screen_videos`, and the pieces' rows are deleted with the chunks' rows written, then their objects. Replay
  (`GET /v1/notes/:id/screen/:share/:segment`) opens only the chunks a range needs, with `nosniff` and `no-store`
  ([Calls and recordings › Shared screens](calls-and-recordings.md#shared-screens)).
- **Shared-screen frames** are taken from that video at the moments the notes worker picks, sealed under `Krec`
  (`screen-frame`), read back and checked, and recorded in `screen_frames` with their grey grid; the same image
  again is kept once. What was read on each is written into its row, and the frames the notes attach go into the
  note's `screens`. Every other frame (not attached, judged unrelated, or no longer picked) only goes into what the
  notes say, and is deleted in the transaction that saves the notes (its object once that commits), unless the
  saved note still shows it
  ([Notes and inference › Shared screens](notes-and-inference.md#shared-screens)).
- **Notes jobs** are inserted `queued` by the stopping transaction, claimed with a lease by the notes worker,
  and deleted when the note is finished ([Notes and inference](notes-and-inference.md#the-notes-worker)).
- **Google Calendar events** are read from Google whenever the app asks (`GET /v1/calendar`) and never
  stored. An Alcove call's event ID and link are kept in its meeting manifest, and for an occurrence of a
  recurring event, the recurring event's ID. A series that repeats is one recurring event: each call keeps its
  occurrence's ID and which recurring event that is, and the series keeps the event that carries its latest calls.
- **Busy times** (`POST /v1/calendar/busy`) are read when the app asks, from Google, from the account's own calls,
  or for a demo account from `apps/api/src/demo.ts`, and go nowhere else: no row, no receipt, and in the logs only
  how many ([Privacy › Google sign-in and calendar access](privacy-keys-and-sessions.md#google-sign-in-and-calendar-access)).
- **Documents** brought to a call are IDs in its meeting manifest, and nothing else about them is kept: a name, whether
  it's still there and who can open it are read from its workspace each time the call is
  ([Privacy › Brought to a call](privacy-keys-and-sessions.md#brought-to-a-call)). An item's own ID doesn't say which
  workspace it's in, so the ID a call keeps names both, `<workspace_id>.<item ID>`, 45 characters; to the wire it's one
  opaque ID (`IDSchema` puts no limit on an ID). That's only for someone who can open it: anyone else is told a name
  worked out for them and that call, which nothing stores. A call stored with the old demo catalog's IDs (`vandelay.…`, `own.…`)
  still opens, with those not listed: they look like nothing else, so they find nothing, and they stay in the manifest
  until the organizer next changes what's brought.
- **The workspace a call uses** is in its meeting manifest (`workspaceId`), with its `agenda`, as IDs. What goes on in it
  during the call is in the call's sealed state (`workspace`: who's asking, what's presented and playing, what's been
  worked on and by whom, and the next agenda while it's being made), and goes when the call ends: what was worked on into the note, if there is one, and nowhere else
  ([Calls and recordings › The call's workspace](calls-and-recordings.md#the-calls-workspace)).
- **A board in a call** is a document in a workspace like any other. The call's sealed state says which is open in each part
  of the call and which boards it lets everyone into (`board`): where each is, who opened or decided it by their name, address and
  seat, and the seats and addresses each has been worked out for, and nothing about what's on it. It goes when the call ends. A call stored
  before this was kept reads as having none
  ([Calls and recordings › A board in a call](calls-and-recordings.md#a-board-in-a-call)).
- **Series.** What a series carries over isn't stored: it's read on each request from the meetings that share its
  ID and the notes the reader has ([Notes and inference › Series](notes-and-inference.md#series)). What a later call
  came back to is in that later note's manifest (`revisits`), and notes written before it read as having none. One scheduled to
  repeat has a `series` item for what belongs to no single call, and a `call_codes` row of its own, which goes
  when its item does. The item goes in the same transaction as its last call, however that call went. Calls that
  follow on from each other in older ways have no item.
- **Taking turns.** A change to a series goes to Google and back, which is too long to hold a row lock: it would
  stop the account's audio uploads, which update the same `owners` row. So `owners.series_turn_until` says one is
  under way. Each change sets it for two minutes if it's free and clears it when it's done, unless it's no longer the
  time that change set: one that took longer lost its turn, and the next one's stays. A second change waits up to 20
  seconds, and it runs out by itself if the process dies.
- **Someone's own notes** are a sealed record for each person and note, written whole under an advisory lock on the
  two, so one person's changes take turns without waiting on any row. They hold pointers, never what's pointed at, and
  what's in them is read for that person each time
  ([Notes and inference › Your own notes](notes-and-inference.md#your-own-notes)).
- **Finding people.** Sign-in looks up `identities` by subject index; people search and the team directory
  check `identities.email_index`; shared notes are found through `note_access.email_index`
  ([Privacy › Blind indexes](privacy-keys-and-sessions.md#blind-indexes)).
- **Who's invited to a call** is its guests, and `meeting_access` mirrors them by hash so people can find it from
  their own accounts: the rows change in the transaction that changes the guests, and any that don't match (calls
  from before the table) are put right when the organizer reads Upcoming. Upcoming, for someone invited, is those
  rows opened with each organizer's keys, each organizer's read together, for the next 90 days; a call that's over has
  lost its rows, or loses them as they're read
  ([Privacy › Who can see a call](privacy-keys-and-sessions.md#who-can-see-a-call)).
- **Who has a note** is its organizer and everyone with a `note_access` row for it. The note's manifest says how
  each of them got it (invited, or shared by whom, with which group, when), and each reader is told their own
  way as `received`. Every reader's list of notes also carries each share to a group (`groupShares`: who, the
  group's name, the latest time), and the addresses of whoever got it afterwards (`sharedWith`), so a share is never
  counted as having been on the call, both worked out from the same recipients. Someone who removed the note from
  theirs has no row, so isn't listed, and a share to a group nobody still holds drops out; sharing with them again
  gives it back.
- **Files in a workspace** are in [Media](#media).
- **Deleting** is physical, whether it's a note, a meeting or a whole account: rows, receipts and objects
  (see [Privacy › Deletion](privacy-keys-and-sessions.md#deletion)). A deleted account leaves no row keyed by
  its ID, except an `object_gc` entry until maintenance deletes an object the store refused.
- **Credits used this month** are summed from the sealed billing history when the balance is read
  (`GET /v1/credits`): nothing about usage is stored in the clear ([Payments and usage](payments-and-usage.md)).

## What's kept, and for how long

Everything, unless the call was set not to keep its transcript or its recording ([Notes and inference › What's kept,
and for how long](notes-and-inference.md#whats-kept-and-for-how-long)):

- **Speech clips** are never stored: each lives in the API process's memory while it's transcribed.
- **`transcript_clips` and `transcript_translations`** last while the recording runs and are deleted in the
  transaction that stops it; the lines move into the note.
- **`call_mls`** lasts while the call runs and is deleted when it ends. **`call_notes`** too, once what was ticked is in
  the note, and upkeep deletes any left by a call a release from before them ended.
- **`meeting_access`** lasts until a call is over: its rows go in the transaction that ends it, and for a call nobody
  held, the first time its organizer or someone invited reads it after it's an hour past its time. They go with the
  call too if it's cancelled or its organizer's account is deleted. A call started again has its rows back.
- **`call_rings`** lasts at most as long as the call, and goes sooner when someone rung comes in or the organizer
  stops ringing them. In a call that goes on that long, a ring goes a day after it ran out.
- **The recording** (`recording_pieces` and their objects), **shared screens** (`screen_shares`, `screen_pieces`,
  `screen_videos` and `screen_frames`, and their objects), **the note and every revision of it** (transcript, notes, corrections and who made them) are kept
  until the organizer deletes the note. Then everything goes in
  one transaction, and the objects after it (failed deletes retried from `object_gc`).
- **A call set not to keep its recording** deletes its `recording_pieces` rows in the transaction that ends the call,
  once the note has what was worked out from them, and the objects after it. The `recordings` row stays, for its key.
- **A call set not to keep its transcript** empties it in the revision that writes the notes for the first time, the
  main room's and every breakout room's, and deletes every earlier revision and the account's receipts in the same
  transaction. A part whose notes can't be written keeps its lines until they are.
- **Questions, answers and catch-ups** are never stored, unless someone keeps an answer in their own notes.
- **Someone's own notes** (`personal_notes`) last while they have the note: they go with the note, when they remove it
  from theirs, with their account, and at the end of the call if they were taken off the invite.
- **What's added to the shared notes** (`note_additions`) lasts until it's taken back, the note goes or its author's
  account is deleted. It stays when its author removes the note.
- **What's in a workspace's Trash** stays 30 days, unless someone deletes it for good first.
- **A document's log** lasts until it compacts, past 200 updates or 1 MiB; what was deleted goes then. **Its versions** last
  until the document does, or until newer ones push them out past 64 MiB.
- **Carets and presence** are never stored: they're in Postgres's notice queue for as long as it takes to deliver them, sealed,
  and in the API process's memory.
- **A file in a workspace** stays until someone deletes it or every document that has it is deleted for good, Trash
  included, and an upload nobody finished for a day. A limit going down never deletes one.
- **`media_upload_days`** and **`media_guest_upload_days`** keep today and yesterday: upkeep deletes anything older. An account's
  rows also go with the account.
- **`service_limits`** keeps a value until someone changes or deletes it.
- **Seats** in `document_access` last while their call does.
- **What a call keeps of its workspace** (who's asking, what's presented and playing, what's been worked on) lasts while the
  call does. What was worked on goes into its note, and a call with notes off keeps only the versions. Asking Alcove about a
  selection keeps nothing.
- **Presenter notes** last until their author empties them, or the document, the workspace or the account goes.

## Operations

```
pnpm db:up      # Postgres 17 + RustFS in Docker
pnpm migrate    # apply new migrations (the API also applies them at start)
pnpm db:reset   # drop your local data and start over (never needed for a schema change)
pnpm db:down
```

Production runs migrations as the Cloud Run job `alcove-migrate` before each deploy, while the previous API
is still serving. Cloud SQL keeps a backup a day for a week, with point-in-time recovery over the same week.

## Changing what's stored

Data survives every deploy (AGENTS.md › Stored data survives every deploy), so both of the shapes it's stored
in move forward without a reset:

- **Tables.** Each change is a new migration, `apps/api/migrations/NNNN_what_it_does.sql`. The API and the
  migration job apply the files a database hasn't had, in order, each once and in its own transaction, under
  an advisory lock so two runs never interleave. They keep each applied file's checksum and refuse a database
  whose applied files were since edited or removed; `scripts/check-migrations.mjs` stops that in CI first. Because
  the previous release is still serving while its successor migrates, a migration only adds (tables, nullable
  or defaulted columns, indexes); dropping, renaming or retyping a column waits for a release that no longer
  uses it.
- **Sealed records.** The API can't change ciphertext from a migration: only the owner's keys, opened per
  request, read it. So a record's shape evolves where it's read. A field added to a stored schema gets a zod
  `.default(...)`, older records take it when they open and are sealed in the new shape the next time they're
  saved; a removed field is ignored when older records open. A field is never renamed or retyped in place, and
  a record's header and its key's derivation label never change while data under them exists.
